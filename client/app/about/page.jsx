            FIRST LEGO League (FLL) is a global robotics competition that aims
            to inspire young people to be leaders in science, technology,
            engineering, and mathematics (STEM). FLL engages students in
            hands-on robotics challenges that encourage creativity, teamwork,
            and problem-solving, all while building essential skills for the
            future.
